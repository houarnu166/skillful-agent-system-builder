# Skillful Agent System Builder

> Just say **"Create a code review system"**, and AI will design a custom agent team through conversation.

[🇰🇷 한국어 버전 README문서 (Korean Version)](./README(kor).md)

## Who is this for?

- ✅ You want to build a **multi-agent system** in Claude Code or Antigravity, but don't know where to start with prompts
- ✅ You need a **custom AI assistant** to automate repetitive tasks
- ✅ You want to quickly apply **best practices** for agent/skill design

## Understand in 30 Seconds

**Input** (what you do):
```
"I need an agent system that helps educators create teaching materials on specific topics"
```

**Output** (what the system creates):
```
./outputs/lesson-material-generator-start-prompt.md
./outputs/lesson-material-generator/
    ├── .agents/
    │   ├── lesson-planner.md
    │   ├── content-writer.md
    │   └── skills/...
    └── AGENTS.md
```

**Result**: Ready-to-use agent team design + project files

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- **Claude Code** or **Antigravity IDE** (AI agent runtime environment)

### How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open in Claude Code or Antigravity
3. Say:
   ```
   "Create an agent system for [your use case]"
   ```
4. Answer the AI's questions, and you're done!

Results are generated in the `./outputs/` folder.

## How It Works

4 specialized AI agents collaborate in sequence:

| Step | Agent | Role |
|:---:|---------|------|
| 1️⃣ | **Sam** | Gathers requirements and asks questions |
| 2️⃣ | **Jenny** | Creates detailed agent and skill designs |
| 3️⃣ | **Will** | Validates quality and fixes issues |
| 4️⃣ | **Tom** | Generates final documents and project files |

```
Your Request → Sam → Jenny → Will → Tom → Complete Agent System
```

### Two Modes

| Mode | Usage | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Normal Mode** | `"Create a..."` | Agent asks questions for careful design |
| **Fast Mode** | `"Quickly. Create a..."` | Immediate output without questions |

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Customer Support System (Normal Mode)
```
Input: "I need a system that classifies customer inquiries, auto-responds with FAQ, and escalates complex issues to staff"

Output:
- 3 Agents: inquiry-classifier, faq-responder, escalation-handler
- 2 Skills: faq-knowledge-base, ticket-routing-rules
```

### Example 2: Code Review System (Fast Mode)
```
Input: "Quickly. A system that analyzes PR code to find potential bugs and security vulnerabilities"

Output:
- 3 Agents: code-analyzer, bug-detector, security-checker
- 2 Skills: code-quality-rules, security-best-practices
```

---

## Output

The **Start Prompt** file generated by the system includes:

1. System overview and purpose
2. File structure (`.agents/` based)
3. All agent definitions (ready to copy and use)
4. All skill definitions
5. Workflow documentation
6. Usage examples

**Usage**: Copy the generated Start Prompt to a new project folder and input it into Claude Code or Antigravity. The agent system will be automatically generated.

## Terminology

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Agent** | An AI that performs a specific role. e.g., Code Analyzer, Document Writer |
| **Skill** | A collection of knowledge/tools used by agents. e.g., Coding Rules, Doc Templates |
| **Start Prompt** | Complete design document for creating an agent team |
| **Orchestrator** | Central manager that coordinates multiple agents |

---

## Customization

### Add New Agent
Create a new `.md` file in the `.agents/` folder

### Add New Skill
Create `.agents/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` file

### Modify Workflow
Edit [skillful-orchestrator.md](.agents/skillful-orchestrator.md)

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Previous session data interfering | `./temp/` folder is automatically cleared |
| Missing context files | Verify required files exist in `./context/` |
| File write permission errors | Check `permissionMode: acceptEdits` in agent frontmatter |
